# BobaShop
Solo project for CodingDojo. A webapp that allows the creation, editing, viewing, and deletion of customized boba drinks.
Features working on: voting system, selection of ingredients as checkbox form, img assets to form onto page as user selects ingredient checkboxes
Current known issues: "account.jsp" does not properly show created drinks, jstl only returns values of first drink
